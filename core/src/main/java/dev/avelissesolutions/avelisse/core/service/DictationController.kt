 * Contract for controlling dictation recording from the IME.

 * implements this interface and exposes it through its LocalBinder.
 *
 * WHY an interface: The ime module cannot depend on the app module (that would
 * create a circular dependency). By defining the contract in core, both modules
 * can share the type without coupling.
