/**
 * Centralized Timber logging initialization.
 *
 * Timber is Jake Wharton's logging library for Android. It wraps
 * Android's Log class and adds automatic tag detection (uses the
 * calling class name as the log tag). The "tree" pattern lets you
 * plant different logging backends:
 * - DebugTree: logs to Logcat with auto-tags (debug builds only)
 * - FileLoggingTree: always-on, writes every log entry to avelisse.log on disk
 *
 * WHY FileLoggingTree in all builds: Debug logs need to survive app restarts
 * and are exportable from Settings, which is useful for diagnosing issues on
 * real devices where Logcat is not accessible.
 *
 * @param isDebug Whether this is a debug build (plants DebugTree for Logcat output).
 * @param filesDir The application's internal files directory where avelisse.log is written.
