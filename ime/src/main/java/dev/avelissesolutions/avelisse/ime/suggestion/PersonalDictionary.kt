/**
 * Tracks how often the user types each word and persists a "learned" set via DataStore.
 *
 * WHY two-layer design:
 * - typeCount (in-memory): Updated on every word type. Reset on IME process restart.
 *   We never write this to disk because DataStore writes are async I/O — doing so on
 *   every keystroke would cause lag.
 * - learnedWords (DataStore-backed): Only written when a word crosses the 2-tap threshold.
 *   Collected reactively via a Flow collector in init so it's always up-to-date without
 *   blocking reads inside getSuggestions().
 *
 * WHY 2-tap threshold (LEARN_THRESHOLD = 2): Avoids learning typos from a single mistype
 * while being responsive enough for frequent words the user actually wants suggested.
